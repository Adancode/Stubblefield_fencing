#STUBBLEFIELD FENCE CO.

##OVERVIEW
This website is one I've been building for a local company. It is currently still under development. (Waiting on HD images, text content, and a about me page that the client will design)

##Design
This is a simple 4 page website (5 pages if you include error page) that is mostly static, but has a node.js backend to allow for future expansion. Layout and styles are done with the materialize library.

##TECHNOLOGIES
	
	* Node.js (Backend)

	* Express.js (Routing)

	* Formspree.io (Mailer)

	* HandleBars.js (Templating/ View Rendering engine)

	* jQuery (required for lightbox gallery and animsition. But as long as it was already being loaded I opted to use it for DOM manipulation)

	* Materialize (layout and styling)
